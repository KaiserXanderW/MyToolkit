## Automations
- Shortcut for inserting current date and Agent ID (YOURNAME3), then places cursor in the center

## Hotkeys
- Ctrl+Space = Enter (When pasting with Ctrl+V, can release V while still holding down Ctrl and the hit enter, which simulates hitting the enter key. This negates the need to take your hand off the mouse to hit the enter key.)

# Setup
- if using a laptop and their function keys are secondary, you'll have to access the bios and reverse that default setting.
